# Without a maximum ISO size all is in one single ISO:
test "$ISO_MAX_SIZE" || return 0

# When a maximum ISO size is set it means the backup could be split on multiple ISOs.
# When the backup is split on multiple ISOs, then "rear mkrescue" would destroy it
# because in the first ISO that is named "rear-HOSTNAME.iso" there is
# in case of "rear mkbackup" the (bootable) ReaR recovery system
# plus the first part of the splitted backup (usually named "backup.tar.gz.00")
# plus the backup.splitted file that contains information about the splitted backup.
# But "rear mkrescue" would overwrite that first ISO with one that contains only
# the new ReaR recovery system but no longer the first part of the splitted backup
# nor the backup.splitted file so that then "rear recover" fails with
# "ERROR: Backup archive 'backup.tar.gz' not found"
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1545
# Accordingly when a maximum ISO size is set the mkrescue workflow is forbidden
# to be on the safe side to not possibly destroy an existing backup.
# Even with a sufficiently big maximum ISO size so that all is in one ISO
# a "rear mkrescue" would overwrite an existing ISO that contains a backup.
